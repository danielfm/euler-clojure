by Daniel F. Martins <daniel.tritone@gmail.com>


This repository provides my solutions to Project Euler's problems using
Clojure, a Lispy JVM-based functional language.


1. Requirements

* JDK 1.5+;
* Clojure, latest svn trunk version;
* Clojure-contrib, latest svn trunk version;


2. Running

Using the terminal, go to the project's root directory and run the following
command line:

    $ clj euler/problem_X.clj

Where X is the problem id.


3. Notice

Don't expect me to publish solutions to all Project Euler's problems! :-)
