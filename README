This repository provides my solutions to Project Euler's problems using
Clojure[1], a Lispy JVM-based functional language.

Project Euler[2] is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to
solve most problems.


1. Requirements

* JDK 1.5+;
* Clojure, git version[3];
* Clojure-Contrib, git version[4];


2. Running

Using the terminal, go to the project's root directory and run the following
command line:

    $ clj euler/problem_X.clj

Where X is the problem id.


3. Notice

Don't expect me to publish solutions to all Project Euler's problems! :-)
